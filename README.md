# Project

This project implements a full-stack web-application using the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/). It is rather simple application and is used for learning purposes. The goal is to have a register that can be used to track persons that went to the same schools.

Often times, when you go to a school, you meet a lot of people. Some of them you might want to keep in touch with, but you might not remember their names. This application is meant to help you keep track of the people you met at school. It also helps to send out invitations to reunions.

### Tech Stack:

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.
